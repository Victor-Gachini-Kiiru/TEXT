TOPIC SENTENCES
<body>
<p class="FIVE">
A paragraph is a series of sentences that are organized and coherent, and are all <br> related to a single topic. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than
    <br> a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because <br> paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end, and
    <br> thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

</p>

<p class="SIX">
Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could <br> contain a series of brief examples or a single long illustration of a general point. It
    <br> might describe a place, character, or process; narrate a series of events; <br> compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or
    <br> describe causes and effects. Regardless of the kind of information they contain, <br> all paragraphs share certain characteristics. One of the most important of these
    <br> is a topic sentence.

</p>

<p class="SEVEN">
  A well-organized paragraph supports or develops a single controlling idea, which <br> is expressed in a sentence called the topic sentence. A topic sentence has
    <br> several important functions: it substantiates or supports an essay’s thesis <br> statement; it unifies the content of a paragraph and directs the order of the
    <br> sentences; and it advises the reader of the subject to be discussed and how the <br> paragraph will discuss it. Readers generally look to the first few sentences in a
    <br> paragraph to determine the subject and perspective of the paragraph. That’s <br> why it’s often best to put the topic sentence at the very beginning of the
    <br> paragraph. In some cases, however, it’s more effective to place another sentence <br> before the topic sentence—for example, a sentence linking the current
    <br> paragraph to the previous one, or one providing background information.
